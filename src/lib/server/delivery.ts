 *
 * `placeName` is `place_names.name`, picked from a select — the free-text street
 * address (`deliveryAddress`) carries no fee. Applied server-side so the fee a
 * browser posts never has to be trusted.
 *
 * Shared by checkout and the dashboard order actions: a fee quoted to a customer
 * and the fee staff see on the same order have to be the one number, so neither
 * side computes it on its own.
