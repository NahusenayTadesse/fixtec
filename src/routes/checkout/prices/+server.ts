 * database. Without a reconciliation step the two disagree silently: the page
 * quotes what the customer saw a week ago and the order records today's price.
 * The checkout page calls this before it will let anyone submit.
 *
 * Variants that no longer exist, or whose product has been deactivated, are
 * simply absent from the response, which is how the caller detects a
 * discontinued item.
 *
 * No authorisation: this returns catalogue prices, which are already public on
